This is made with BepInex, so you need to install it following their guide:
https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

With BepInEx installed, now place the SurvislandTweaks.dll into BepInEx/Plugins/SurvislandTweaks/ (subfolder optional)

Run the game once and a config file is created called BepInex/Config/SurvislandTweaks.cfg

Edit the values in there to your liking and start the game back up.
